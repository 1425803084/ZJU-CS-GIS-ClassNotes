WOODS NEAR QUANTICO, VA

Starling!

3
Starling!

4
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

5
Thank you, sir.

6
- Clarice.
- Hey.

7
You looking for Crawford? He should
be back in a minute. Wait in his office.

8
Starling.

9
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Crawford.

10
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

11
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

12
I hope so. They haven't
posted any grades yet.

13
A job's come up and I thought about you.

14
Not a job, really. More of
an interesting errand. Sit down.

15
Yes, sir.

16
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

17
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.

18
A-minus, sir.

19
Double major: psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.

20
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

21
It says, when you graduate, you wanna
work for me in Behavioural Science.

22
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

23
We're interviewing all serial killers now in
custody for a psycho-behavioural profile.

24
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

25
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

26
- Do you spook easily, Starling?
- Not yet, sir.

27
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

28
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

29
- Who's the subject?
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

30
Hannibal the Cannibal.

31
I don't expect him to talk to you.

32
But I have to be able to say we tried.

33
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

34
How does he look? How does
his cell look? Is he sketching, drawing?

35
If he is, what's he sketching?

36
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

37
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

38
Have your memo on my desk
by 08:00 Wednesday.

39
OK.

40
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison for so many years.

41
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

42
I wish there were.
Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

43
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

44
Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all
the physical procedures used with him.

45
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

46
And you're to tell him nothing personal.

47
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

48
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

49
And what is that?

50
Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.

51
So rare to capture one alive.

52
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

53
We get a lot of detectives here, but
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

54
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

55
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

56
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton,

57
but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

58
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

59
We've tried to study him, but he's much
too sophisticated for the standard tests.

60
Oh, my, does he hate us!

61
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

62
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

63
- What do you mean, sir?
- A pretty, young woman to turn him on.

64
I don't believe Lecter's
seen a woman in eight years.

65
And are you ever his taste! So to speak.

66
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school.

67
Good. Then you should
be able to remember the rules.

68
Do not touch or approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.

69
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paperclips in his paper.

70
Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts
to pass you anything, do not accept it.

71
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

72
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

73
On July 8, 1981 , he complained of chest
pains and was taken to the dispensary.

74
His restraints were removed for an EKG.

75
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

76
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

77
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.

78
- I keep him in here.
- Dr Chilton.

79
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

80
then maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself. What do you think?

81
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

82
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

83
When she's finished, bring her out.

84
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

85
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

86
Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can
hang your coat up there if you like.

87
Thank you. I will.

88
He's past the others, the last cell.

89
You keep to the right.

90
- I put out a chair for you.
- That's very good. Thank you.

91
I'll be watchin'. You'll do fine.

92
Hi.

93
I can smell your cunt!

94
- Good morning.
- Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

95
May I speak with you?

96
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

97
- I am, yes.
- May I see your credentials?

98
Certainly.

99
Closer, please.

100
Closer.

101
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

102
I'm still in training at the academy.

103
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

104
Yes, I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

105
Maybe you can decide whether or not
I'm qualified enough to do that.

106
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

107
Sit, please.

108
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

109
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

110
He hissed at you. What did he say?

111
He said ''I can smell your cunt.''

112
I see.

113
I myself cannot.

114
You use Evyan skin cream.

115
And sometimes you wear l'Air du Temps.

116
But not today.

117
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

118
That is the Duomo
seen from the Belvedere.

119
- Do you know Florence?
- All that detail just from memory, sir?

120
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

121
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

122
Oh, no, no, no, no.

123
You were doing fine. You had been
courteous and receptive to courtesy.

124
You had established trust, with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

125
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

126
- It won't do.
- I'm only asking you to look at this.

127
Either you will or you won't.

128
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

129
if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

130
Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.

131
What a naughty boy he is.

132
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

133
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

134
It started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

135
They said
''This one likes to skin his humps.''

136
Why do you think he removes
their skins, Agent Starling?

137
Thrill me with your acumen.

138
It excites him. Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

139
- I didn't.
- No. No, you ate yours.

140
You send that through now.

141
Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can
dissect me with this blunt little tool?

142
No. I thought that your knowledge...

143
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

144
Do you know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

145
You look like a rube.

146
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube,
with a little taste.

147
Good nutrition's given you length of bone,

148
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash, are you?

149
And that accent you've tried so
desperately to shed: pure West Virginia.

150
What is your father, dear? Is he
a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?

151
How quickly the boys found you.

152
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

153
while you could only dream of
getting out, getting anywhere,

154
getting all the way to the FBI.

155
You see a lot, Doctor.

156
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

157
What about it? Why don't you look at
yourself and write down what you see?

158
Or maybe you're afraid to.

159
A census taker once tried to test me.

160
I ate his liver with some fava beans

161
and a nice Chianti.

162
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

163
Fly, fly, fly.

164
I bit my wrist so I can die.

165
Look at the blood!

166
- Got ya!
- Miggs, you stupid fuck!

167
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Agent Starling! Come back!

168
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.

169
- Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.
- Then do this test.

170
No, but I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

171
- And what is that?
- Advancement. Listen carefully.

172
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.

173
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

174
I don't think Miggs could manage again
so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!

175
Hey, Bill.

176
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

177
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.

178
FBI. Hands up. Don't move.

179
Turn around.
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

180
You're dead, Starling.

181
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

182
- The corner.
- Did you check?

183
- No.
- That's why you're dead.

184
3109.

185
3109. Breaking doors or windows

186
to enter or exit.

187
Rule 404.

188
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

189
- Starling?
- Sir?

190
Miggs is dead.

191
Dead?

192
How?

193
They heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

194
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

195
- Starling?
- Yeah. I'm still here, sir.

196
I just... I don't know how to feel about this.

197
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

198
Look, I know it got ugly today, but
you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.

199
Any follow-up on her?

200
Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories,

201
so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet, but

202
I thought the ''yourself'' reference
was too hokey for Lecter,

203
so I figured he's from Baltimore
and I looked in the phone book

204
and there's a ''Your Self'' storage facility
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

205
Unit 31 was leased for ten years,
pre-paid in full.

206
The contract is in the name
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

207
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

208
Not to my knowledge.

209
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

210
Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.
I'll be outta here before you know it.

211
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

212
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

213
What about him?

214
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labour.

215
Right. Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

216
It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.

217
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

218
this is the number for
our Baltimore field office.

219
Now they know that you're with me.
Call them if anything should happen.

220
Yes, Miss Starling.

221
Clarice. They're waiting for you.
Watch your step.

222
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, Doctor?

223
Hester Mofet. ''The rest of me.''

224
''Miss the rest of me.''
Meaning that you rented that garage?

225
- Thank you.
- Your bleeding has stopped.

226
How did you...?

227
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.

228
Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

229
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

230
- Do you know something about him?
- I might if I saw the case file.

231
- You could get that for me.
- Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

232
You wanted me to find him.

233
His real name is Benjamin Raspail,
a former patient of mine,

234
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

235
I did not kill him, merely tucked him
away very much as I found him,

236
after he'd missed three appointments.

237
- If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
- Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

238
His therapy was going nowhere.

239
His dress, make-up...

240
- Raspail was a transvestite?
- In life? Oh, no.

241
Garden-variety manic-depressive.
Tedious, very tedious.

242
I now just think of him
as a kind of experiment.

243
A fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

244
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

245
Scared at first, then exhilarated.

246
Jack Crawford is helping your career.
Apparently he likes you and you like him.

247
I never thought about it.

248
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

249
True, he is much older, but do you think
he visualises scenarios, exchanges,

250
fucking you?

251
That doesn't interest me and, frankly,
it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

252
Not any more.

253
Thank you, Barney.

254
What happened to your drawings?

255
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel programme.

256
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

257
Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

258
What did you mean
by ''transformation'', Doctor?

259
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

260
I know they will never ever
let me out while I'm alive.

261
What I want is a view.

262
I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.

263
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr Chilton.

264
What did you mean by ''fledgling killer''?
Are you saying that he's killed again?

265
I'm offering you a psychological profile of
Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.

266
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

267
You know who he is, don't you?

268
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

269
All good things to those who wait.

270
I've waited, Clarice, but how long
can you and old Jackie Boy wait?

271
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

272
MEMPHIS, TN

273
Hey, little cheeper.

274
I'll be right there.

275
Can I help you with that?

276
- Would you?
- Sure.

277
- Thank you.
- You look kinda handicapped.

278
Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't
get it up in the truck by myseIf.

279
- Here. Grab this.
- OK.

280
Just set it down. That's good.

281
Get in the truck.
I wanna push it all the way up.

282
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Thank you.

283
Push it all the way back.

284
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

285
- That's great.
- OK.

286
Say, are you about a size 14?

287
Sorry?

288
Good.

289
Oh, good.

290
Good.

291
Starling!

292
Outside. Let's go.

293
Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.

294
FBI!

295
Pack your field gear.
You're going with Crawford.

296
- Where?
- They found a girl's body.

297
Been in the water a week.
It's a Buffalo Bill situation.

298
CLAY COUNTY, W VA

299
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

300
No evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

301
All the mutilation
you see there is postmortem.

302
OK, three days. Then he shoots them,

303
skins them and dumps them,
each body in a different river.

304
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

305
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

306
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

307
so actually she was the third girl found.

308
After her, he got lazy.

309
OK, let's see.

310
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

311
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

312
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

313
He's a white male. Serial killers tend
to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

314
He's not a drifter. He's got his own
house somewhere, not an apartment.

315
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

316
He's in his thirties or forties.
He's got real physical strength,

317
combined with
an older man's self-control.

318
He's cautious, precise...

319
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

320
Why not?

321
Got a real taste for it now
and he's getting better at his work.

322
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

323
Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything
about the information in my report

324
or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.

325
- I'm considering it.
- That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

326
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

327
Well, if that was the case, then
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

328
If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.

329
He would have toyed with you
then turned to stone.

330
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

331
Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry.

332
Agent Starling. We appreciate
being invited into your jurisdiction.

333
I didn't call you. That was
the state attorney's office.

334
- We'll extend you every courtesy, but...
- Sheriff.

335
This type of sex crime has certain aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

336
Know what I mean?

337
- Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.
- Starling, we're back here.

338
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

339
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

340
I need a six-way linkup.

341
Chicago, Detroit...

342
What?

343
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen,

344
listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.

345
I know that y'all brought her this far and
her folks would thank you if they could

346
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

347
But now please go on now
and let us take care of her.

348
Go on now.

349
Thank you.

350
Thank you.

351
OK, good.

352
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.

353
Stand by for transmission.

354
Ray.

355
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

356
OK, Starling.

357
Bill.

358
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

359
A muzzle stamp at the top.

360
Wrongful death.

361
She'll have to go to
the state pathologist at Claxton.

362
Well, I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help you.

363
Lord Almighty.

364
What else do you see, Starling?

365
Well, she's not local.

366
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's glitter nail polish.

367
That looks like town to me.

368
Two of her fingernails are broken off
and there's dirt or grit under them.

369
It looks like she's tried
to claw her way through something.

370
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.

371
Let's do another.

372
She's got something in her throat.

373
When a body comes out of the water,
lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.

374
What is that? Some kind of seed pod?

375
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

376
There's no way that could
get way down in there.

377
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

378
She'll be easier to print when we turn
her over. Lamar, give me a hand.

379
Yes, sir. I wiII.

380
- Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
- Different configuration than the others.

381
- Get close-ups.
- The victim's skin removed,

382
this time in two large diamond-shaped
sections above the buttocks.

383
Exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

384
six inches from the right shoulder blade.

385
Starling, when I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

386
that really burned you, didn't it?

387
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

388
It matters, Mr Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

389
- It matters.
- Point taken.

390
Ligature marks found around the wrists,
not around the ankles.

391
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem.

392
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- You lured him with produce.

393
Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

394
Nice and slow, baby.

395
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

396
Course it counts. How do you play?

397
Agent Starling?

398
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

399
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim in the Elk River.

400
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I can't tell you any more.

401
- We heard about it on the radio.
- This is a clue from a real murder case?

402
- Cool.
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

403
Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.

404
Boy, he's a big sucker.

405
OK. Let's check morphology.

406
What do you do when you're
not detecting, Agent Starling?

407
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.

408
Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

409
The amusing house wine?

410
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

411
Yes.

412
- Gotcha.
- What have you got?

413
Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.

414
Weird.

415
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

416
- Where does it come from?
- It's strange. They only live in Asia.

417
Here they'd have to be
raised from imported eggs.

418
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey
and nightshade, kept him warm.

419
Somebody loved him.

420
Where are you?

421
Let me outta here!

422
Help me!

423
Please!

424
Please help me.

425
Please!

426
Why won't you answer me? Please!

427
- Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

428
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.:

429
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

430
listed as missing, is now
believed to have been kidnapped

431
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

432
Police indicate that the girl's
blouse has been identified,

433
sliced up the back, in what has become
a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.

434
Young Catherine Martin is the only
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

435
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

436
Her kidnapping is not considered
to be politically motivated,

437
but it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

438
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Vermont, the president is said to be,

439
and I quote, ''intensely concerned''.

440
Just moments ago Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea.

441
I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.

442
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

443
Talk to her and you'll see.

444
You have the power. You are in charge.

445
I know you can feel love and compassion.

446
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

447
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

448
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

449
You have that power.

450
Please.

451
My daughter is Catherine.

452
Boy, that's smart.
Jesus, that's really smart.

453
She keeps repeating the name.

454
If he sees Catherine as a person and not
just an object, it's harder to tear her up.

455
Release my little girl.

456
You're coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

457
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

458
Sir, I told you, this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

459
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

460
Look, I am not just
some turnkey, Miss Starling.

461
This is the number
for the US attorney's office.

462
Either you discuss this with him or you
let me do my job, do you understand?

463
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill
in time to save Catherine Martin,

464
the senator promises you a transfer

465
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.

466
Maximum security still applies, of course.

467
You'd have reasonable access to books.

468
Best of all, though,

469
one week of the year,
you get to leave the hospital

470
and go here.

471
Plum Island.

472
Every day of that week you may walk on
the beach, you may swim in the ocean,

473
for up to one hour, under SWAT team
surveillance, of course.

474
And there you have it.

475
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

476
A copy of the senator's offer.

477
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

478
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

479
''Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Centre.''

480
Sounds charming.

481
That's only a part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

482
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?

483
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be ''turns'' with us too.

484
Quid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

485
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

486
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

487
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

488
Go, Doctor.

489
What is your worst memory of childhood?

490
The death of my father.

491
Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.

492
He was a town marshal.

493
One night he surprised two burglars

494
coming out the back of a drugstore.

495
They shot him.

496
Was he killed outright?

497
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

498
My mother died when I was very young.

499
My father had become the whole world to
me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.

500
I was ten years old.

501
You're very frank, Clarice.

502
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

503
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

504
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

505
- Yes.
- Big through the hips? Roomy?

506
- They all were.
- What else?

507
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

508
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

509
Was it a butterfly?

510
Yes. A moth.

511
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

512
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

513
The significance of the moth is change.

514
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa,

515
and from thence into beauty.

516
Our Billy wants to change, too.

517
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

518
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

519
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him, do you realise that?

520
No. Tell me why.

521
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

522
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

523
I lived with my mother's cousin and her
husband in Montana. They had a ranch.

524
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

525
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

526
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

527
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

528
Did he sodomise you?

529
No. He was a very decent man.

530
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

531
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

532
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

533
You said that I was very close to the way
we would catch him. What did you mean?

534
There are three centres for
transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,

535
the University of Minnesota
and Columbus Medical Centre.

536
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment at all of them

537
and been rejected.

538
On what basis would they reject him?

539
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

540
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

541
He was made one through years
of systematic abuse.

542
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

543
and he thinks
that makes him a transsexual.

544
But his pathology is
a thousand times more savage

545
and more terrifying.

546
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

547
Mister, my family'll pay cash. Whatever
ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

548
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

549
Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.

550
OK, OK.

551
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges, I promise.

552
See, my mom is a real important woman.

553
I guess you already know that.

554
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

555
Please!

556
Please!

557
I wanna go home, please!

558
It places the lotion in the basket.

559
I wanna see my mommy!

560
Please!

561
I wanna see my...

562
I wanna see my mommy.

563
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

564
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

565
I don't think so.

566
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

567
She never heard of any deal with you.

568
They scammed you, Hannibal.

569
Stand outside.

570
And shut the door.

571
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

572
I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

573
Identify Buffalo Bill by name
and, if the girl is found in time,

574
Senator Martin will have you transferred
to the state prison in Tennessee.

575
Answer me, Hannibal.

576
You answer me now or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

577
Who is Buffalo Bill?

578
His first name is Louis.

579
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

580
And I have a few conditions of my own.

581
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

582
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

583
Transferred?

584
Did you have a trainee make a phoney
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

585
Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.

586
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

587
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

588
MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

589
Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant
Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

590
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

591
You be a gentleman, you're gonna
get three hots and a cot.

592
Sir. You sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

593
Where's...?

594
Here, sir. Use mine.

595
Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.

596
Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

597
You'll wanna read it before I sign.

598
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time, bargaining for petty privileges.

599
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack
Crawford have wasted far too much time.

600
I only pray they haven't
doomed the poor girl.

601
Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.

602
You have my word. Paul?

603
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

604
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May 1980

605
by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.

606
They were lovers, you see.

607
But Raspail had become very frightened.

608
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

609
and done things with the skin.

610
We need his address
and a physical description.

611
Tell me, Senator. Did you
nurse Catherine yourself?

612
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

613
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

614
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

615
Amputate a man's leg
and he can still feel it tickling.

616
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

617
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

618
Five foot ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

619
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.

620
He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived
in Philadelphia but may have lied.

621
That's all I can remember, Mom, but if
I think of any more, I will let you know.

622
And, Senator, just one more thing.

623
Love your suit.

624
In a meeting this evening
with Senator Ruth Martin,

625
Dr Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

626
of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.

627
- How do you fit in?
- My insight into Lecter's mind

628
- made this breakthrough possible.
- Buffalo Bill's real name?

629
That is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

630
- My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.
- How do you spell that?

631
- Are you with Dr Chilton's group?
- Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

632
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've been getting death threats.

633
I understand, sir.

634
Log in and check your weapon.

635
I can't take all the credit.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

636
people at the FBI, folks
at the Baltimore state hospital.

637
And now for the hard part:
apprehending the suspect.

638
Excuse me, folks.
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

639
Is it true what they're sayin'?

640
He's some kind of vampire?

641
They don't have a name for what he is.

642
You do know the rules, ma'am?

643
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

644
Go ahead.

645
Good evening, Clarice.

646
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

647
Just until you get your view.

648
How very thoughtful.

649
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

650
before you're both booted off the case?

651
No, I came because I wanted to.

652
People will say we're in love.

653
Anthrax Island.

654
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

655
- Yours?
- Yes.

656
Yeah.

657
That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

658
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

659
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

660
Louis Friend?

661
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

662
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

663
You were telling me the truth back in
Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.

664
I've read the case files. Have you?

665
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

666
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

667
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each
particular thing, ask what is it in itself?

668
What is its nature?

669
What does he do, this man you seek?

670
- He kills women.
- No. That is incidental.

671
What is the first thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

672
Anger.

673
Social acceptance.

674
- Sexual frustrations.
- No. He covets.

675
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

676
Do we seek out things to covet?

677
Make an effort to answer now.

678
No. We just...

679
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

680
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

681
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

682
All right, yes. Now please tell me how...

683
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

684
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

685
Why did you leave that ranch?

686
Doctor, we don't have
any more time for any of this now.

687
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

688
- This is all the time you'll ever have.
- Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...

689
No. I will listen now.

690
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

691
You went to live with cousins on
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

692
And?

693
And one morning I just ran away.

694
Not ''just'', Clarice. What set you off?

695
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

696
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

697
I heard a strange noise.

698
What was it?

699
It was screaming.

700
Some kind of screaming.
Like a child's voice.

701
What did you do?

702
I went downstairs.

703
Outside.

704
I crept up into the barn.

705
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

706
What did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

707
Lambs.

708
They were screaming.

709
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

710
And they were screaming.

711
- And you ran away?
- No. First I tried to free them.

712
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

713
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

714
But you could - and you did, didn't you?

715
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

716
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know. I didn't have any food,

717
any water and it was very cold, very cold.

718
I thought...

719
I thought if I could save just one, but...

720
He was so heavy.

721
So heavy.

722
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

723
The rancher was so angry, he sent me
to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.

724
I never saw the ranch again.

725
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

726
- He killed him.
- You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

727
Wake up in the dark

728
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

729
Yes.

730
And you think, if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

731
You think if Catherine lives,

732
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

733
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

734
I don't know.

735
I don't know.

736
Thank you, Clarice.

737
- Thank you.
- Tell me his name, Doctor.

738
Dr Chilton, I presume.

739
I think you know each other.

740
OK.

741
- Let's go.
- It's your turn, Doctor.

742
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

743
Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have
to put you on a plane. Come on now.

744
Brave Clarice.

745
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

746
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
- Clarice.

747
Your case file.

748
Goodbye, Clarice.

749
- Ready when you are, doc.
- Just another minute, please.

750
Son of a bitch demanded a second
dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.

751
I wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

752
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- OK, doc. Grab some floor.

753
Same drill as before, please.

754
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

755
OK.

756
Hand me that, would ya?

757
Thanks.

758
Mind the drawings, please.

759
Thank you.

760
Watch it. He's cuffed me!

761
Jesus Christ!

762
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

763
What is this shit?

764
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

765
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

766
CP. Shots fired on five.
Repeat: shots fired on five.

767
Sergeant Tate.

768
- Holy shit.
- What the hell...?

769
Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.

770
- Right, sarge.
- Brady, Howard, cover...

771
Look!

772
- It's stopped.
- Seal off a ten-block radius.

773
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

774
We're goin' up.

775
Pembry!

776
Boyle!

777
Oh, God.

778
Go.

779
- Clear.
- Command post.

780
Two officers down.

781
- Lecter's gone, sarge.
- Prisoner is missing.

782
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.

783
He's stripped the bed. Might be
makin' a rope. Check all windows.

784
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

785
He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.

786
Get a hold of him
and feel his hand. Talk to him.

787
- What do I say?
- It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!

788
Lecter is missing and armed.

789
Pembry, can you hear me?

790
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one
round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.

791
Keep breathin' in and out.
That's it. You're doing a good job.

792
You look real good.

793
Yeah, you look real good.

794
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

795
Let's go.

796
Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna
make it. You're doin' just fine.

797
I need that IV now!

798
Can we get the straps?
Where's the fucking oxygen?

799
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

800
We're losin' him. Downstairs.

801
And up.

802
Elevator!

803
CP to Tate.

804
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

805
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

806
He seems to be hangin' on.

807
Top three floors secured.

808
Main stairwell secured.

809
We think he's on two.

810
Tate, are you still with me?

811
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two,
sir. That's all for now. Over.

812
He's on the roof of the elevator.

813
OK, guys.

814
I see him.

815
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

816
- One warning: we need him alive.
- Got it.

817
Lecter, put your hands on your head.

818
One in the leg.

819
No movement.

820
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're comin' into the car.

821
We're openin' the hatch.

822
Watch his hands.
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

823
- Affirm.
- Got it.

824
Memphis General, medical unit 26.

825
We're inbound with a male police officer
with severe facial lacerations.

826
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.

827
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 1 30 over 90.

828
- 90?
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.

829
We got him on lactated Ringer's and
the patient is on ten litres of oxygen...

830
They found the ambulance in a parking
garage at the airport. Crew was dead.

831
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

832
- By now he could be anywhere.
- He won't come after me.

833
- Oh, really?
- He won't.

834
I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.

835
- It's over. She's dead.
- It's not your fault it worked out like this.

836
The thing is that Lecter said everything
we need to catch him is in these pages.

837
Dr Lecter said a lot of things.

838
He's here, Ardelia.

839
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

840
''Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random,

841
like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Hannibal Lecter.''

842
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

843
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

844
But there is no pattern
or the computers would have nailed it.

845
- They were even found in random order.
- Random because of the one girl.

846
- The one he weighted down.
- Fredrica Bimmel.

847
From Belvedere, Ohio.

848
First girl taken, third body found.

849
- Why?
- She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

850
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

851
- Simplicity.
- What does this guy do? He covets.

852
How do we first start to covet?

853
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

854
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

855
BELVEDERE, OHIO

856
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.

857
I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

858
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr Bimmel.

859
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

860
Police been back here
so many times already.

861
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

862
She left the interview OK.
She never come home.

863
Her bedroom's how she left it.

864
Upstairs. Door to the left.

865
He's making himself a ''woman suit'',
Mr Crawford, out of real women.

866
He can sew, this guy. He's very skilled.

867
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker.
- Starling...

868
That's why they're so big. He has to
keep them alive so he can starve them,

869
- so that he can loosen their skin.
- Starling, we know who he is.

870
And where he is.
We're on our way right now.

871
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

872
Be on the ground in 45 minutes.

873
That's great news, sir, but how...

874
Johns Hopkins came up with some
names. We fed 'em into Known Offenders.

875
Subject's name
is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a John Grant.

876
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

877
Customs had some paper on him.

878
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX. Live caterpillars from Surinam.

879
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

880
Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

881
No, Starling. There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

882
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl.
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.

883
Yes, sir, you bet. I'll do my best.

884
Starling, we wouldn't
have found him without you.

885
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

886
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr Crawford.

887
Mr Crawford?

888
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

889
I got a better idea.

890
OK, Precious. Time for a little treat.

891
Precious!

892
Come on, girl!

893
Come on, Precious.

894
Come on, Precious!

895
I got a yummy snack for ya!
Come on. Come and get it.

896
Precious!

897
Are you up there, you little shit?

898
Come and get it, pretty girl.

899
Precious, please come. Come on.

900
Would you fuck me?

901
Come on. Take that bone.

902
I'd fuck me.

903
Come on.

904
I'd fuck me hard.

905
I'd fuck me so hard.

906
No.

907
AIR NATIONAL GUARD HQ
CHICAGO, IL

908
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

909
I mean, better places than this?

910
Sometimes you do.

911
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

912
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

913
She thought it was such hot shit.

914
What did she know? Big dummy.

915
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

916
- How about John Grant?
- No.

917
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

918
If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.

919
- Sewing was her life.
- Did you two ever work together?

920
Sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used to help
her do alterations for old Mrs Lippman.

921
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

922
CALUMET CITY, IL

923
So powerful. So beautiful.

924
Precious?

925
- Precious?
- She's down here, you sack of shit!

926
- Put her in that bucket.
- Get me a telephone and lower it down.

927
Poodlie-poo. Precious.

928
- Darling heart, are you all right?
- She's in a lot of pain. She needs a vet.

929
She broke her leg
on the way down. I know it.

930
- Don't you hurt my dog!
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!

931
You don't know what pain is!

932
- Oh, fuck!
- You better be gettin' me that telephone!

933
I'm gonna do it, mister!

934
All right, mister! I'm doin' it!

935
OK, I'm coming.

936
We're goin' in.

937
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs Lippman's family.

938
FBI! Everybody down!

939
No, Lippmans don't live here any more.

940
Excuse me.
I really need to speak with you.

941
Clear!

942
What's the problem, officer?

943
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

944
There's no one here, Jack.

945
Clarice.

946
- Your name is?
- Jack Gordon.

947
Mr Gordon. Good. Well, Fredrica used to
work for Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?

948
No. Uh-uh.

949
Oh, wait.

950
Was she a great, big, fat person?

951
- She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I may have...

952
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

953
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

954
I got his card here someplace.
Come in while I look for it.

955
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

956
Are you close to catchin'
somebody, you think?

957
Yes. We may be.

958
Did you take over this place
after Mrs Lippman died, is that right?

959
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.

960
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

961
Tax forms? List of employees?

962
No, nothin' like that at all.

963
Say, has the FBI learned something?

964
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

965
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

966
No.

967
No, we don't.

968
Here's that number.

969
Very good, Mr Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

970
Sure, you can use my phone.

971
Freeze! Put your hands over your head.

972
And turn around. Spread your legs.

973
Spread your legs.
Put your hands in the back. Thumbs up.

974
Freeze!

975
Hello? Are you there?

976
I'm down here!

977
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

978
FBI. You're safe.

979
Safe, shit! Get me outta here!

980
- You're all right. Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?

981
- Just get me outta here!
- You gotta be quiet. Shut that dog up.

982
Just get me outta here!

983
Oh, my God.

984
Catherine, I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

985
I've gotta leave this room. Be right back.

986
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fuckin' bitch!

987
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!

988
Please!

989
I gotta get outta here!

990
Catherine, the other officers'll
be here any minute now.

991
Wait! Don't go! Please!

992
Quiet!

993
- You OK?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm OK.

994
How did you track Buffalo Bill here?

995
Clarice M Starling.

996
Congratulations.

997
Special Agent Starling.

998
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

999
- Excuse me.
- Starling.

1000
Pilch, could you take our picture?

1001
Yeah. Sure.

1002
Look, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

1003
I'm not much good at this kinda thing,
so I'm gonna duck outta here.

1004
OK. Sure.

1005
Thank you, Mr Crawford.

1006
Your father would have been proud today.

1007
Don't forget your phone call.

1008
- Starling.
- Well, Clarice?

1009
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

1010
- Dr Lecter.
- Don't bother with the trace.

1011
I won't be on long enough.

1012
- Where are you, Dr Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

1013
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

1014
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

1015
You know I can't make that promise.

1016
I do wish we could chat longer but...

1017
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

1018
- Bye.
- Dr Lecter?

1019
Dr Lecter?

1020
Excuse me. You got
the security system all set up?

1021
- We have the big-shot security.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
