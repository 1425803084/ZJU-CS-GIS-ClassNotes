1
-Is he here yet?
-No.

2
-You scared him.
-I gotta take a massive piss.

3
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

4
Anyone got any beer?

5
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

6
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

7
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

8
-Thanks a lot, Eric.
-Anytime, anywhere.

9
-This is gonna be sweet.
-I'm glad I thought of it.

10
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

11
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

12
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

13
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

14
Belinda, why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

15
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

16
You know I don't dance.

17
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

18
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

19
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

20
Like yourself.

21
He's here!

22
All right, here he comes.

23
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

24
I can't wait to see you fly!

25
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

26
You're late.

27
I thought I said be here at 10,
but you know....

28
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

29
If there is a next time!

30
Dean! ls he always like that?

31
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

32
Wait up, baby!

33
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

34
Okay, here's the deal.

35
You're gonna jump
from up there into here.

36
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

37
-You ready?
-Yeah.

38
All right. All right.

39
Let's do this, okay?

40
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

41
-How deep is this?
-I don't really know.

42
Let's go find out.

43
Let's do it.

44
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

45
Come on, let's go!

46
Jump!

47
-You done this?
-We've all done it.

48
-I hope you had your Wheaties!
-You guys gonna do this tonight?

49
On three.

50
One.

51
Two.

52
Three!

53
Oh, shit.

54
Landon, he's hurt!

55
-Is he okay?
-Landon, get down here!

56
-What the hell?
-Dean, what the hell?

57
-You guys, he's hurt!
-Come on, man!

58
-I told you it was a bad idea!
-Get him out of the water!

59
-Hurry up!
-Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

60
Help me!

61
-Get him over here!
-There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

62
Get him out of the water!

63
Watch his head! Watch his head!

64
Hey, who's down there?

65
Tracie, come on!

66
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

67
Come on, Landon.

68
Come on!

69
You guys, just take him!

70
Give me his arms!

71
I got him.

72
We gotta get out of here.

73
-Go! Get out of here!
-Landon, come on!

74
I told you not to do this!

75
Calm down.

76
Belinda, let's go!

77
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

78
Damn it!

79
Shit!

80
Put your hands on the wheel.

81
You know, Mama,
my leg really hurts today.

82
I don't think I can go anyplace.

83
-Maybe I should call your father.
-No.

84
I'm not talking to him.

85
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

86
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

87
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved...

88
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

89
-So how's the leg, man?
-It's good.

90
I can't believe you were in jail.

91
-What'd you tell them?
-It was a nice night for a drive.

92
Ended up at the cement factory,
found Gephardt.

93
Tried to help him, got spooked.

94
Figured I'd leave before
they thought I was involved.

95
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

96
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

97
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

98
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

99
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

100
A little maintenance,
she might not look bad.

101
Nice sweater.

102
Thank you.

103
Thank you.

104
A student claims you were drinking
on school property.

105
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

106
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

107
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

108
What, are you gonna expel me?

109
Not yet.

110
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

111
-For pay?
-For the inner satisfaction it brings.

112
Saturdays, you'll tutor students
at our sister school.

113
You'll take part
in the drama club's final event.

114
The spring play?

115
It's time you experienced
other things.

116
Started spending time
with other kinds of people.

117
Don't blow it, Landon.

118
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

119
-Does anyone know what it is?
-It's a star frame.

120
This is a star frame.

121
It will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

122
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

123
Bet you can see angels up there,
flying around.

124
There are things that
could be called miraculous.

125
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

126
Well, if there is a higher power...

127
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

128
He's too busy looking for your brain.

129
Laugh, it's a joke.

130
-Let's get out of here.
-I gotta stay.

131
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

132
Come on. Come on.

133
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

134
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

135
Look at the chart,
you'll see Halley's comet.

136
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

137
My parents aren't home,
if you want to come inside.

138
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

139
I know. I just thought....

140
It's over.

141
Yeah. Whatever.

142
Okay.

143
Good morning, Landon.

144
Landon, wake up!

145
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

146
Up!

147
It's Saturday, no school.

148
Tutoring.

149
Let's try this again.

150
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

151
What do you think?

152
Man, I think this is bullshit!

153
Makes two of us.

154
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

155
I'm trying to raise money
to buy Jefferson new computers.

156
No.

157
So I saw you in there with Luis.

158
And I know it can be difficult...

159
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

160
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

161
That would be a no.

162
They moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place.

163
Is this your idea of small talk?

164
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

165
-It's called peer pressure.
-How do you know?

166
You read it in your precious book?

167
Please don't pretend
like you know me, okay?

168
But I do. I do.

169
We have all the same classes
since kindergarten.

170
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

171
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

172
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

173
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

174
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

175
How's that sound?

176
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

177
-You don't care what people think?
-No.

178
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

179
This is bullshit. Thanks.

180
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

181
-Be back in an hour.
-Tell them to do West Side Story.

182
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

183
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

184
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

185
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

186
Eddie, perhaps--

187
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

188
Sure.

189
Now then, let's see....

190
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

191
-Sally will be playing Caroline.
-Congratulations.

192
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

193
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

194
When did you know, Tommy?

195
IKnow what?

196
That we were in love.

197
Love?

198
Baby, you don't want to fall
in love with a guy like me.

199
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

200
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

201
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

202
...pour me another glass.

203
Are you trying to be bad at this?

204
No, just comes naturally.

205
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

206
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

207
-Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right. See you.

208
Bye.

209
-So would it kill you to try?
-Yep, and I'm too young to die.

210
You don't care about classes,
but you like school...

211
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

212
-That's thoroughly predictable.
-Your act only works on an audience.

213
Feeling Christian?

214
Seat belt?

215
-I forfeit.
-Thank you.

216
Forty-two.

217
What do you mean, forty-two?

218
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

219
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

220
Like getting a new personality?

221
Join the Peace Corps,
make a medical discovery.

222
Ambitious.

223
Be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

224
What's number one?

225
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

226
I've come...

227
...to see if you're ready.

228
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

229
Ready to look into your heart,
Tom Thornton.

230
Your words have been heard,
and not just by me.

231
When you walked into....

232
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

233
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

234
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

235
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

236
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

237
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

238
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

239
I didn't write it, okay?

240
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

241
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

242
I'm just busting on you.

243
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

244
With tomatoes.

245
Thanks, man.

246
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

247
-Yeah.
-No problem.

248
Jamie.

249
What do you want?

250
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

251
I need help with my lines.

252
-Landon Carter's asking me for help?
-Yeah.

253
Okay, I'll pray for you.

254
Jamie, look--

255
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

256
A request like yours requires
flattery and groveling.

257
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

258
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

259
-Please?
-Okay. One condition, though.

260
What's that?

261
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

262
-That's not a problem.
-Okay. I'll see you today after school.

263
Landon Carter is coming here?

264
He's dangerous, careless,
the worst kind of bully.

265
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

266
I thought we had discussed
that I would decide...

267
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

268
It's him I don't trust, not you.

269
You gonna keep me out here
all afternoon?

270
Come on in.

271
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

272
Oh, yeah.

273
It's not likely.

274
That is one scary-looking--

275
-Jesus!
-No, Jamie's father.

276
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

277
Congratulations.

278
Thanks for letting me
come over and run lines.

279
I didn't let you.

280
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

281
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

282
But I see you.

283
I'll be in my office, just here.

284
Ready?

285
Yeah, let's go.

286
-Landon! Where have you been?
-Nowhere.

287
-Hey, come here.
-What's up?

288
-Are we cool?
-Yeah, sure.

289
What the hell?

290
-What are you doing here?
-I should ask you the same.

291
Do you normally walk alone
in a cemetery at night?

292
Maybe.

293
Where you going?

294
Come and see.

295
Okay. What is that?

296
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 1 2.

297
Take a look.

298
Saturn. Very cool.

299
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

300
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

301
Nature's miracles. I get it.

302
-Get what?
-That you're into all this stuff.

303
This stuff?

304
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

305
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

306
Without suffering,
there's no compassion.

307
Tell that to those who suffer.

308
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

309
-She's trashy.
-Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

310
Here comes your leading lady.

311
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

312
In your dreams.

313
Hi. Where's your sweater?

314
Let's get out of here.

315
What's up, dude?

316
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

317
What do you want?

318
-You're not in a good mood.
-You don't miss a thing.

319
Listen, I was hoping
we could run lines together.

320
Okay, but just not
so anybody knows, right?

321
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

322
We could be secret friends.

323
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

324
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

325
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

326
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

327
But I was very wrong.

328
Damn it!

329
Sorry. Sorry.

330
You know the answer?

331
Come on, man, I know you know.

332
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

333
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

334
Take a step towards the basket.

335
Am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

336
-Yeah.
-Are you?

337
-Yeah.
-So, what did we just make?

338
-A similar triangle?
-Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

339
You got it, two sides the same.

340
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

341
I came to say I'm sorry.

342
Well, you did. Feel better?

343
No. I feel like shit.

344
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

345
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

346
I made that jump once.

347
I thought I was a badass.

348
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly flop.

349
Did it hurt?

350
Like hell.

351
Good.

352
So I guess I'll see
you at school then.

353
-Pour me a drink, Joey.
-You promised me, Tommy.

354
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

355
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

356
I won't sit on my keister
and watch the fat cats get rich.

357
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

358
That's it! We are through!

359
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

360
And I hope you drown in it!

361
So you must be the new girl
he's hired.

362
The singer?

363
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

364
He's nothing but trouble
in cheap spats.

365
Look, I ain't blaming you.

366
I ain't asking for forgiveness,
either.

367
I just did what I had to.

368
When you walked out of the rain
and into my club...

369
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

370
Nothing's coincidence.

371
Your face.... You look so familiar.

372
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

373
Tell me about this dream girl.

374
Well, I don't remember.

375
All I know...

376
...is you're beautiful.

377
The song, the song.

378
The dream.

379
Help me to remember.

380
Will you sing for me?

381
That was great.

382
Hi, kids.

383
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

384
Thanks, but please stop.

385
-Don't be home too late.
-Okay. Thanks.

386
Okay, okay.

387
-Interesting rewrite you did there.
-I did my best.

388
Your acting didn't suck either.

389
-Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
-Okay.

390
-Landon, you were marvelous!
-Thank you.

391
Landon? Fine performance, son.

392
-What are you doing here?
-I thought we'd get a bite.

393
-I'm not hungry.
-Don't walk away.

394
You taught me how.

395
Oh, my God.

396
Look who's here.

397
Don't look at him.

398
You don't want to stare too much.

399
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

400
-People can see.
-That would ruin your reputation how?

401
What's that?

402
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

403
-And how many books are there?
-A hundred.

404
But then there's his British list
and his European list.

405
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

406
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

407
Maybe....

408
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

409
-Maybe you inspire me.
-Sounds like bull.

410
-Which part?
-All of it.

411
-It's not.
-Prove it.

412
Jamie!

413
-You've no idea how to be a friend.
-I don't just want that.

414
-You don't know what you want.
-You're scared someone wants you.

415
-Why would that scare me?
-You couldn't hide behind books...

416
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

417
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

418
It's because you want
to be with me too.

419
We gonna get this party jumping!

420
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

421
You really know how
to bust a robot's groove.

422
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

423
What we got here?

424
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

425
Jamie lent it to me.

426
You're listening
to her people's music.

427
-Her people?
-Yeah...

428
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

429
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

430
-She's not like that.
-Well...

431
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

432
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

433
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

434
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

435
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same shit all the time.

436
This girl's changed you,
and you don't even know it, man.

437
-Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
-No.

438
I did.

439
You.

440
Me.

441
What is it?

442
I got you something.

443
Thank you.

444
Well, I'll see you at school.

445
Okay.

446
-Mr. Carter.
-Later, Reverend.

447
Boys like that...

448
...they have....

449
They have expectations.

450
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

451
Fine.

452
You might not care
what I say or think...

453
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

454
I think he wants me to be happy.

455
Dad, it's just a sweater.

456
I'm going to make us
some dinner, okay?

457
I talked to your dad today.

458
Said he saw you at the play
for about 10 seconds.

459
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

460
-Landon, there are a lot of reasons--
-He left us.

461
You need to forgive him too.

462
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

463
She was looking all right
in that play.

464
She doesn't look hot.

465
Yeah, I would have to say during
the play, she looked hot.

466
I have the best idea.

467
Can you do something, like, move it?

468
Maybe move it around
a little something here.

469
Take one.

470
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

471
Hey, look at this.

472
Here.

473
Take one. Look.

474
-Jamie. Hi.
-Hi.

475
Listen, I just want you to know,
no hard feelings.

476
Landon and I are way over.

477
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

478
You'd be so beautiful...

479
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

480
-Come on, eat lunch with me.
-Okay.

481
-Want a Tic Tac?
-No, thanks.

482
Okay.

483
Wow.

484
Is that you?

485
Nice bod.

486
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

487
Stay here.

488
Hey, man, no wonder you been
keeping her locked up.

489
I had no idea this was
underneath all that.

490
-Dean, stop!
-You stay out of this!

491
-We're through. We're through.
-That's great.

492
-We're through forever!
-You okay?

493
-You made a mistake, Landon!
-You sure?

494
Let's get out of here.

495
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

496
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

497
They're animals, all right?

498
You want me to take you home?

499
Let's get out of here.

500
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

501
-Thank you for everything.
-You're welcome.

502
-I want to ask you something.
-Okay.

503
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

504
I'm sorry. I can't go.

505
-You have something else going on?
-No.

506
-It's not that.
-Then what is it?

507
I'm not allowed to date.

508
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

509
Whatever a man sows,
that he will also reap.

510
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap--"

511
-Can I help you?
-Yes, sir.

512
I'd like to ask your daughter
to dinner on Saturday night.

513
That's not possible.

514
With all due respect, sir,
I ask you to reconsider.

515
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

516
You can exit the way you entered.

517
I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

518
She deserves more than that.

519
I'm asking you for the same thing...

520
...you teach us every day in church.

521
And that's faith.

522
I can't believe you asked permission.

523
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

524
-Thank you.
-This is for you.

525
-Thank you very much.
-Would you like something to drink?

526
-Sweet tea, please.
-Make that two.

527
Right away.

528
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

529
-Don't even worry about it, okay?
-Okay.

530
Choose whatever you want.

531
So, what'll it be?

532
Is everything okay?

533
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah, me too. Thanks.

534
Would you like to dance?

535
Sorry, I don't dance.

536
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

537
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

538
Everybody can dance.

539
Come on, you can't be that bad.

540
Please?

541
For me?

542
Come on.

543
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

544
-In all fairness, you warned me, right?
-That's right.

545
So, what's number one on your list?

546
Okay.

547
Number one on my list
is getting out of Beaufort.

548
Getting out won't be your problem.

549
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

550
What do you mean?

551
I mean, you can do anything.

552
-Where are we going?
-Just hold on, you'll see.

553
Come on, come on. Let's go!

554
-What are we doing?
-Run!

555
-Okay, okay. Stand there.
-All right.

556
-One foot there, and one foot here.
-Okay.

557
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

558
Right now, you're straddling
the state line.

559
Okay.

560
You're in two places at once.

561
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

562
You choose.

563
-Butterfly.
-Okay.

564
Where do you want it?

565
Right here.

566
Okay.

567
How can you see places like this...

568
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

569
You're lucky to be so sure.

570
It's like the wind.

571
I can't see it, but I feel it.

572
What do you feel?

573
I feel wonder and beauty...

574
...joy, love.

575
I mean, it's the center of everything.

576
I might kiss you.

577
I might be bad at it.

578
That's not possible.

579
I love you.

580
Now would be the time
to say something.

581
I told you not to fall in love with me.

582
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

583
Landon, go home. The night's over.

584
-Good night.
-Good night.

585
Good night, sir.

586
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

587
-You act with that boy like you're--
-In love?

588
-Jamie, you are a child.
-Dad, look at me...

589
-...l'm not a child.
-Then stop acting childish.

590
I love him.

591
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

592
-Hey.
-Hey.

593
-Will you help me?
-Yeah.

594
So, what did you tell your father?

595
The truth. I just left you out of it.

596
So, what do you want to see?

597
Pluto.

598
Pluto only rises a few minutes
before the sun.

599
Right...

600
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

601
...and a blanket.

602
-You planned this.
-Oh, I hoped for it.

603
Are you trying to seduce me?

604
Why? Are you seducible?

605
That's what I thought...

606
...ergo, a second blanket.

607
-One for me, and one for you.
-Thank you.

608
-Can you find this star right here?
-Sure.

609
So why am I looking for this star?

610
Because I had it named for you.

611
See?

612
It's official.

613
It's from the lnternational
Star Registry.

614
This is wonderful!

615
I love you.

616
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

617
So, what's your number one?

618
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

619
That's where my parents were married.

620
-Did you just get in?
-Yeah.

621
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

622
Sorry.

623
Landon, were you with Jamie?

624
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

625
-Mom--
-Please!

626
It's different with her.

627
-It's different with her.
-Yes.

628
It better be different with her.

629
I was doing laundry the other day,
and I found this.

630
"Examine a moon rock.

631
Go to college.

632
Get into medical school."

633
Honey, these are really
beautiful ambitions.

634
-But you'll have to work really hard.
-I can do that.

635
Yeah, you can.

636
Mama...

637
...Jamie has faith in me.

638
You know?

639
She makes me want to be different.

640
Better.

641
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

642
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

643
Are you worried
about your college applications?

644
No.

645
I'm not applying.

646
-I thought you said--
-No, you assumed.

647
-Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
-No.

648
What are you gonna do?

649
I'm sick.

650
-I'll take you home, you'll be--
-No, Landon!

651
I'm sick.

652
I have leukemia.

653
No.

654
-You're 18, you're perfect.
-No.

655
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

656
So why didn't you tell me?

657
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

658
I didn't want anybody
to be weird around me.

659
-Including me?
-Especially you!

660
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

661
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

662
Dad, open the door!

663
Landon?

664
-I need your help.
-What's wrong? You okay?

665
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's....

666
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

667
Okay, calm down.

668
-Can you help me or not?
-I don't know her case.

669
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't--

670
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

671
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

672
Your mom called me.

673
Talk to me, man.

674
About what?

675
About you...

676
...about Jamie.

677
What's there to talk about?

678
She's the best person I've ever known.

679
I didn't understand.

680
It's okay, man.

681
It's okay.

682
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

683
I'm not going anywhere.

684
Please tell Jamie that.

685
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

686
I made you do too many things--

687
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

688
Are you scared?

689
To death.

690
Lighten up.

691
It's not funny.

692
I'm scared of not being with you.

693
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

694
I'll be here.

695
Mom.

696
Can you do me a favor?

697
So I talked to Eric.

698
Need some help with this stuff?

699
Sure.

700
What's that boy doing in the yard?

701
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

702
Landon. Run along, son.

703
I'm not tired.

704
I need just a minute with her.

705
-I'll be back, okay?
-Okay.

706
Daddy...

707
...so serious.

708
Do you remember
when you were about 5 or 6...

709
...and you said you hated gravity...

710
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

711
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

712
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

713
Dad....

714
You know, when I lost your mother...

715
...l was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

716
Jamie, I couldn't look
at you for days.

717
But then....

718
I love you so much.

719
I wanted to give you these.

720
The pictures from the play.

721
-I'm sorry about the flyers.
-It doesn't matter.

722
I guess you're with who you should be.

723
It's like she chose you.

724
Yeah, I don't even know why.

725
I do.

726
How you feeling?

727
-I'm okay. How are you?
-Pretty good.

728
-I have something for you.
-You do?

729
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

730
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

731
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

732
-Come on.
-Okay, let's check it out.

733
"What is a friend?

734
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

735
-Right here.
-Okay.

736
"Find out who you are...

737
...and do it on purpose."

738
That's Dolly Parton.

739
I always thought she was smart.

740
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

741
Love is never boastful or conceited.

742
It is never rude or selfish.

743
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

744
-You know what I figured out today?
-What?

745
Maybe God...

746
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

747
Like, this journey never ends.

748
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick.

749
To help me through all this.

750
You're my angel.

751
What's going on?

752
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

753
-What does she mean?
-He's been trying to reach you.

754
He's going to pay
for private home care.

755
Thank you.

756
Sorry.

757
It's all right, son.

758
-I gotta finish this tonight.
-Here, something hot.

759
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

760
-Yeah, they're in here.
-Good.

761
-What about side bearings?
-An old phonographic turntable.

762
So you think you can get
all this done by tomorrow?

763
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

764
It's beautiful.

765
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

766
There it is.

767
Come here. Come look.

768
Come here. Come look, quick.

769
That is cool.

770
Do you love me?

771
-Will you do something for me then?
-Anything.

772
Will you marry me?

773
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

774
-I love you.
-"Love is never boastful nor conceited.

775
It is never rude or selfish.

776
It does not take offense
and is not resentful.

777
Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins...

778
...but delights in the truth.

779
It is always ready to excuse,
to trust, to hope...

780
...and to endure...

781
...whatever comes."

782
-I, Landon Rollins Carter...
-I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

783
...do solemnly swear...

784
-...to take Jamie Sullivan...
-...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

785
-...as my wife.
-...as my husband.

786
To honor and to cherish her,
all the days of my life.

787
Jamie and I had a perfect
summer together...

788
... with more love than lots ofpeople
know in a lifetime.

789
And then she went,
with her unfailing faith.

790
It's been four years...

791
...but the vision ofJamie
walking towards me...

792
... will stay with me forever.

793
Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

794
-Have a seat, please.
-Thank you.

795
Landon.

796
-You look good.
-Thank you. You too.

797
I'm getting by.

798
-What's new, Landon?
-Well, I got into medical school.

799
Your mother told me that.

800
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

801
Listen.

802
I want you to have this.

803
Oh, Landon.

804
Oh, my.

805
Thank you.

806
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

807
She did.

808
It was you.

809
Jamie saved my life.

810
She taught me everything.

811
About life, hope...

812
...and the longjourney ahead.

813
I'll always miss her.

814
But our love is like the wind.

815
I can't see it...

816
...but I can feel it.
